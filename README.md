===============================================================================

* Author: Sven Ehrke

This project provides a collection of directory templates (see https://github.com/svene/directory_template).
Currently supported are:

* java
* java/swing
* gradle

Note that code is in a very early state and so far mearly served to have a use case
for developing https://github.com/svene/directory_template.
Feedback and contributions in form of improvements of the existing code and
new templates is highly appreciated.
